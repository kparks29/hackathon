File & Folder Layout
--------------------

Each folder contains an Angular module. In each folder, you'll see these common files:

* init.js - This registers the module and its dependencies. The starting point for an angular module.
* config.js - Defines the configuration behavior for the Angular module. (Optional)
* run.js - Defines the code that is run when the module is initialized. (Optional)
* README.md - Describes the module

Each folder can also contain many files that define services, constants, and models associated
with a particular module.
